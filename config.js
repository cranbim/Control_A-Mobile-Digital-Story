texts[0]="For a few years in the 00’s I worked as a lowly campsite steward at Glastonbury festival, probably the least empowered or glamorous role in the huge festival machine. But I was proud to be part of it all the same. Its a micro society, and often feels like a visit to a foreign country with its own rules and customs. There are conditions to entry, but once inside its largely self organising. There are drugs and crime of course, but also harmony. The motive for gaining pleasure at someone else's expense is minimal when there is just so much damned extraordinary entertainment and experience on hand. It is truly mind blowing how big the site is, what there is to see."
+" // "
+"But what amazes me is how people do behave. There are lovely people, there are dick heads, and there is the general, good natured, low-level selfishness that teenagers and young twenty somethings emit. When things go wrong, like a heat wave, flash floods, trampled tents, or loss of water, people kind of organise themselves and mostly respond with good nature. Towards the middle of Sunday though, fatigue is setting in, and I think the huge social experiment would fray at the edges if it went for much longer."
+" // "
+"The joy of being right at the bottom rung of the vast machine is that you don’t have any authority, so no-one has problem with you. In the first year that I did this, the organisers decided to change a long established rat run through one of the camp fields into one way only, due to some safety issues the previous couple of years. I had to stop tractor drivers who work the farm all year, delivery drivers who have been coming to the site for decades, and make them go the long way round. They did not like it. This is probably my only experience of being the enforcer of a seemingly arbitrary rule, which led to facing off with numerous people. I cannot say I enjoyed being that enforcer, the thin brown line defending a rule that I myself would question the utility of, but there were a couple of high points. I got to stop a LandRover full of police and tell them they had to back up and turn around. Even Michael Eavis himself, in his golf buggy, had to grudgingly accept my enforcement of his rule.";


texts[1]="In the 1988 John Carpenter film, They Live, a race of aliens have taken over the world and are controlling the human race through advertising, consumption, and societal behaviour. The humans that comply are rewarded with better lives. They are part of the club, while those who resist are punished and hunted. It’s a thin veil of sci-fi over a clear fable, warning about the likely destination of consumerism."
+" // "
+"I’m not really one for shopping. I like stuff, but I am satisfied with having enough, and I don’t enjoy the process of buying. Occasionally I have a They-Live moment and I look at advertising or some product promotion and I think:  Really? Does anyone fall for this?"
+" // "
+"Trying to choose a toothpaste (33 variations at the supermarket just for Colgate) can be a paralysing confrontation of choice. I know I am a slave to all the same psychological wiring as everyone else, and I am not immune to advertising, or product placement. Sometimes it saddens me just how easily we have our buttons pressed and how willingly we are shamed by some apparent inadequacy into seeking redemption through a product.";


texts[2]="Your brain plays an amazing trick on you. Because your experience of 'being' happens in the conscious mind, it feels like you (the conscious self) is at the top of a mental and biological hierarchy, in command of all we do. This is an illusion."
+" // "
+"Your preconscious mind is running almost every aspect of your physical and mental function. Many separate, unconnected processes are happening at the same time, with no executive control, and without any need to bother your consciousness, according to biologically, neurally, and hormonally encoded rules. These learned and prewired rules are really fast, "
+"and are enough to take care of almost all of your functioning. Some mental tasks cannot be met by these simplistic rules, and the preconscious mind simply outsources the mental heavy lifting to this expensive (in terms of energy), slow, huge, highly capable cortex that it drags around with it. I am sure that the sense of consciousness, the illusion of agency and control is just a nicety to sweeten the grim reality that your conscious self is merely the slave of a biological machine.";

texts[3]="Stepping over the line of expected behaviour, deliberately breaking a rule, flouting some control, is a bitter sweet thing. It's incredibly empowering, and often consequence free (by which I mean that for ourselves in that moment there are no manifest consequences). Hidden damage or simply karma may be the true price, but even tiny transgressions can have an effect. The disapproval of others is sometimes a powerful deterrent and a sufficient reprimand for stepping out of line. But courting this disapproval can sometimes be the very reason and the reward for doing something deemed as wrong. You can almost harvest the displeasure of others, through their dirty looks, the audible tuts, the folded arms, knowing that it is only their own bile that is bothering them, not any true harm from the act itself.  It seems, in that moment,  to set you apart from others, temporarily elevating you, and diminishing them.";

texts[4]="People control people"
+" // "
+"Babies learn very quickly to manipulate the behaviour of their parents to meet their own needs, without needing to understand what those needs are. From then on we spend our lives refining this skill. We learn the power of belonging and exclusion, how to make deals with others for mutual advantage. We learn how to cheat, and how to behave when we are busted."
+" // "
+"We learn how to behave so we are easier to get along with, so people take notice, and how to show others we notice them. We learn to be kind, and sometimes cruel and selfish. We learn the power of tiny gestures - the direction of our gaze, eye contact - held or avoided."
+" // "
+"There is a whole language of gesture and poses built on top of a set of unconscious body responses and tells, that we learn to cover up. We learn to flirt, how to indicate dominance or submission."
+" // "
+"We learn the power of silence, of attention granted or withheld, of praise and reprimand. We learn that passive aggressive gestures can be as effective as direct confrontation. We learn the power of language to make, serve or deny demands. We learn to make arguments out of language, first from childish selfishness, then from logic, and finally from empty but convincing rhetoric."
+" // "
+"Some learn to fake all of these to pretend convincingly to be other people, in order to entertain us. Some do the same to manipulate us."
+" // "
+"Some learn to take these to a level where they can control another’s perception of reality and beliefs about themselves as a form of control. Some entire nations live under illusions woven and maintained by a few.";
// +" // "
// +"The strangest thing about the tics was that I could be doing them for quite a while, completely unaware until I spotted the change in the room, the gaze of other children. My tics calmed down in my late teens, but not because I controlled them. You cannot control them, you only make a deal with them. Attempts to suppress them just creates an impatient queue of angry tic’s that eventually just burst out in a riot of uncontrolled movement, gurning and cutter utterances. I always found it best simply to sneak them out under the flimsy guise of normal gesture, or to find a discrete place to have a brief celebration of thrashing, and to buy me a few minutes of calmness. As an adult I still have episodes from time time to time. I am often completely unaware of them.";
